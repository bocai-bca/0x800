# How to control

# The gameplay
All the numbers are showing as hexadecimal.  
There'll spawn a new block after each move. Usually the number of new block is the minumum number on screen, so the game objective was changed from stacking larger number to decrease the difference between max and min as possible for surviving better.  
  
Let's just call current minimum number as `N`.
Sometimes the new number will be `N - 1`. Game will spawning `N - 1` more and more if them keep existing.  
They will increase challenge for you to maintain order of situation. But don't be afraid, there won't appear `N - 2`.  
  
Very easier than vanilla 2048.  
Try how large number and how high score you can get!
